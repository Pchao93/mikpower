If you're all about the gameplay, then Overwatch is the game for you.\n\nI am 60 hours into the Overwatch, and` I think they did a great job of letting the players do what they want in the immersive environment. Don't expect it to be like other FPS games because this one is special. They may have similarities at some levels, but this is a great game.\n\nIn addition, you could also have the option to enjoy the game in solo mode. If internet connection not your thing, then you could play it offline. Is it fun playing alone? Of course! Is it fun playing online with friends? Absolutely! Mounting a monster always satisfies me and the combat system is great. The atmosphere and the environment are just gorgeous. I was stunned by the beautiful ecosystem and looking at what's around me. You will enjoy every cutscene you encounter. The story is engaging, and it makes you feel that you are actually in the game. At this point, there is nothing to complain about with the game. Veterans will love this game, but for newcomers, they will somewhat complain about it. However, there is a learning curve. If you are interested in it and willing to put the time and effort then this is the game for you.",

The steep learning curve turns off newbies to FPS games. \n\nThe environment in Overwatch is vibrant and sharp. The aesthetic is appropriate, but performance limitations hamper more impressive visuals. Overall, performance is just OK.\n\nThe story is linear and threadbare. A positive for players who want to jump into action. For the rest of us, it's unimaginative and boring. Playing with friends is a blast.\n\nThe learning curve is unnecessarily steep. New players will get lost because the opening tutorials suck and nothing is fully explained. Inventory management is a mess. However, players shouldn’t hesitate to experiment. \n\nGameplay is the weakest link. Moving is awkward. In all situations, character movement lacks fluidity. Camera angles are erratic and controlling it is a chore. The targeting feature is awful.\n\nOnce players grasp its nuances, they’ll that these flaws can be overlooked.",

The combat system is also garbage. On the positive side, the world is definitely the biggest I have ever seen, and the graphics are beautiful. The colors and detail is very vibrant. I can't help but feel like they could have done it better. Honestly everything in this game feels like it is mediocre and rushed. For what they were trying to accomplish with this game, they needed at least a 4 year development cycle or more to be able to pull it off, without it feeling cheap like it does. There is some fun here, and the story is. . . decent? Because of this I still think it is mediocre at best, and only worth a buy after a couple of price drops. Just skip this title until it's in the sales bin.",

I can't help but feel like they could have done it better. Honestly everything in this game feels like it is mediocre and rushed. For what they were trying to accomplish with this game, they needed at least a 4 year development cycle or more to be able to pull it off, without it feeling cheap like it does.

But, as soon as I started, it began to feel like the mechanics of the game were actively working against me, stopping any fun from actually happening. It's not a huge thing. At first it was just a few annoying things that were easily ignored. But once the game really starts pushing you, all the cracks feel so apparent.\n\nThe gameplay feels so incredibly slow and clunky.
